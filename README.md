# RecipeNexus

## Description
Welcome to my Recipe Sharing Web Platform, RecipeNexus! This is a MERN stack project that allows users to create, view, and share recipes with other users. Whether you're a cooking enthusiast or just looking for new culinary inspirations, this platform is designed to make recipe sharing a delightful experience.

## Goals
This project serves as an exploration and learning journey into the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It's a comprehensive endeavor to understand the nuances of full-stack development, covering various aspects from user authentication to crafting a web API using Node and Express, and finally building a frontend with React.js and Next.js.

## What I've Explored
- **MongoDB:** Understanding and implementing database structures to store recipe information and user data securely.
- **Express.js:** Building the backend framework to handle API requests, middleware, and routing for seamless communication.
- **React.js:** Crafting a frontend interface for an engaging user experience with interactive components and state management.

## Features
This is currently a work-in-progress, and many features are subject to change or addition in the future.
- **User Authentication:** Self-built authentication for the purpose of studying how authentication works at the lower level. Continuous study and improvements will be necessary for a complete and robust authentication system.
- **Create Recipes:** Users can easily create and share their favorite recipes, complete with recipe title, description, ingredients, and instructions. Future additions will include recipe image, and other features.
- **Search and Filter:** Efficient search functionality and filters to discover recipes based on categories, ingredients, or user preferences will be added in the future.
- **View and Share:** Browse through a wide array of recipes, view detailed information, and share them with friends or social media.
- **Community Interaction:** Engage with other users by commenting on recipes, liking, and bookmarking favorites.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices with a user-friendly and responsive design.

## Next Steps

- **Further Refinement:** Continuously improve code quality and project structure.
- **Enhancements:** Expand features, such as advanced search options or social interactions among users.
- **Continuous Learning:** Explore more advanced concepts and additional technologies within the MERN ecosystem.
